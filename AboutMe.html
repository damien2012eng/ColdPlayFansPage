            Coldplay are a British rock band formed in London in 1996.[1][2] Vocalist, rhythm guitarist and pianist Chris
            Martin, lead guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman, and drummer Will Champion met at University College
            London and began playing music together from 1996 to 1998, first calling themselves Pectoralz and then Starfish
            before finally changing their name to Coldplay. After changing their name to Coldplay, the band recorded and released
            two EPs: Safety in 1998 and The Blue Room in 1999. The latter was their first release on a major record label, after
            signing to Parlophone.[6] Coldplay achieved worldwide fame with the release of the song "Yellow" in 2000, followed
            in the same year by their debut album Parachutes, which was nominated for the Mercury Prize. The band's second album,
            A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002), was released to critical acclaim. Their next release, X&Y, was the best-selling
            album worldwide of 2005. Their Brian Eno-produced fourth studio album, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008)
            was the best-selling album worldwide of said year and earned three Grammy Awards.
